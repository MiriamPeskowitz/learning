(EN notes @ Chingu) Doing the front-end single project, in order to get more comfortable with CSS. Lots of googling, with a focus on CSS simplicity and flexbox. UPDATE: i chose the CSS solo project, because I've been wanting to work with CSS and become more familiar with it, and then I realized I don't have the time for the 2 month group project. Next voyage perhaps. Did learn to deploy to Heroku. Will keep working on the clone project. 

-learning more about PWA's and using IndexedD. Did this tuto and put it here: https://github.com/MiriamPeskowitz/indexedDBwithDexieTuto

-more on css and semantic HTML, feeling like I want to know more advanced topics. Working with display and summary, mark for highlighting, and time with the datetime attribute, that doesn't render but is important for search engines. 


-responsive navbars without using bootstrap and other libraries (also note: using p tag with a, because a is an inline element, and if you want a horizontal navbar, is a good choice rather than ul and li and then having to use display: inline-block to change it.) https://itnext.io/how-to-build-a-responsive-navbar-using-flexbox-and-javascript-eb0af24f19bf
  
-back to react: working on understanding functional JS, with its pure functions and focus on higher-order functions   https://www.robinwieruch.de/gentle-introduction-higher-order-components/, which also brought me to this article: https://www.sohamkamani.com/blog/2017/08/21/enums-in-javascript/

-I had wanted to understand the "true &&" the logical && operator, which brought me to this article on conditionals and different ways to use them in React https://www.robinwieruch.de/conditional-rendering-react/. That was part of how I ended up again at higher order functions and enums.
